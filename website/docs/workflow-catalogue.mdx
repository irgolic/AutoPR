# 🌊 Workflow catalogue

See here for a list of default workflows that you can use in your own repositories.

## `summarize_pr`

The `summarize_pr` workflow summarizes a pull request by:
- getting the diff of the pull request,
- generating a summary of the diff,
- posting a comment with the summary.

You can invoke it by using the following trigger:

```yaml
triggers:
  - type: label
    label_substring: summarize
    on_pull_request: true
    workflow: summarize_pr
```

And adding a `summarize` label to a pull request.

## `generate_readme_summaries`

The `generate_readme_summaries` workflow:
- crawls the repository's folders,
- summarizes each file and folder,
- generates a `README.md` file with the summaries in each folder.

The following parameters are available:
- `FILE_SUMMARY_PROMPT`: the prompt to use when asking for a summary of a file.
- `FILE_SUMMARY_INSTRUCTIONS`: the instructions to use when asking for a summary of a file.
- `FOLDER_SUMMARY_PROMPT`: the prompt to use when asking for a summary of a folder.
- `FOLDER_SUMMARY_INSTRUCTIONS`: the instructions to use when asking for a summary of a folder.
- `IGNORE_FILES`: a list of files to ignore when crawling the repository.
- `EMPTY_FILE_SUMMARY`: the summary to use when a file is empty.

You can invoke it by using the following trigger:

```yaml
triggers:
  - branch_name: main
    run: generate_readme_summaries
    parameters:
      FILE_SUMMARY_PROMPT: "Write an executive summary of this file, intended for someone seeing it for the first time. Write 3-6 bullet points, prefixed with emojis."
      FILE_SUMMARY_INSTRUCTIONS: "Respond in 3-6 bullet points, using plenty of emojis."
      FOLDER_SUMMARY_PROMPT: "Write an executive summary of this folder, intended for someone seeing it for the first time. Respond in 3-5 sentences."
      FOLDER_SUMMARY_INSTRUCTIONS: "Respond in simple sentences, using plenty of emojis."
      IGNORE_FILES:
        - docs
      EMPTY_FILE_SUMMARY: "This file is empty."
```

The above trigger will run the workflow whenever the `main` branch is updated.
